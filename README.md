# Crossy-Road-Mimic - CS 190 Final Project

This project was created to be a rough mimic of the mobile game, Crossy Road. It was created as part of the final project in CS 190 - Computer Science I at Western Colorado University.

In order to install this project, ensure that you have an up-to-date version of Python installed on your machine. Install all the files in this repository and keep them together in the same folder.
In order to run this project, simply execute the TraversyRoad.py file using Python. The GUI should be generated as soon as the file is executed.

The project was created entirely in Python using the tkinter library.
